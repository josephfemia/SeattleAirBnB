# Installations
To run the jupyter notebook you will need Python 3. The libraries that are used within the notebook include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn. Make sure that you install all libraries by running:
pip install [libraries name here]

Another way to install is by downloading and using Anaconda. This is my preferred way because it comes with the necessary libraries as well as jupyter notebook already installed rather than installing all one by one.

# Motivation
I was motivated to dig deeper into the Seattle AirBnB listing dataset because I wanted to put my analysis and machine learning skills to the test with a real-life dataset. When analyzing this dataset a few questions came to mind. I wanted to know if it was possible to create a price prediction model. There can be many benefits to a model like this. For example, this model can be used to create an estimated price for that lsiting to help those that are posting listings. It can also help customers by providing them with a tool to see if they are over-paying or under-paying for that specific listing. 

I then wanted to analyze and learn more about how ratings and price interact with eachother. I was curious as to what kind of information the rating of a specific listing tells the consumer about the price point. I wanted to find out if those that tend to have higher ratings also tend to have a slightly higher price. 

Finally, the last thing that I created was a classification tool to predict which classification the room would fall under. This classification tool can be super useful when analyzing larger datasets from AirBnB in the Seattle region. I wanted to create something that would help the business on the backend by creating a tool that efficiently predicts the room types for listings. This is super useful because it can be used to fill in null values in a much larger dataset and potenitally provide much more data points to do futher analysis on than before.

# Descriptions
- Seattle AirBnB.ipynb - This is the jupyter notebook that contains all of the gathering, cleaning, questions, and analysis for this specific dataset.
- listings.csv - This is the csv file that contains all of the listing information. This dataset was provided by AirBnB and only contains the Seattle Area.

# How to use the Project
For starters, to be able to run the project you must have everything installed that was mentioned in the Installations section. After that, open up whatever command prompt you feel comfortable with and navigate to where you downloaded the file. From there launch jupyter notebooks and open the file. 

This project has many aspects of it that are useful to many people. It is well commented for those to follow along. As stated earlier, the models and analysis contained within this notebook has benefits for all parties (those renting places on AirBnB, those making listings on AirBnB, as well as backend help for AirBnB themselves). This project can also be used to help others with the data analysis process as well as machine learning. I encourage you to follow my code step by step. Hopefully, I am able to help someone gather a depper understanding of code.
